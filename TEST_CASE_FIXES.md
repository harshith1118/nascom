# Test Case Generation Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. The AI prompt for generating test cases was not explicit enough about the expected output format
2. The prompt didn't clearly separate the test cases from the compliance report
3. Error handling in the frontend was not robust enough to provide helpful feedback
4. The parser didn't handle cases where the AI response might include additional text

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Improved AI Prompt
- Made the prompt more explicit about generating exactly 3 test cases
- Provided a clear format specification for each test case
- Added clear instructions for separating test cases with "---"
- Specified where the compliance note should be placed and how it should be labeled

### 2. Enhanced Flow Processing
- Added better parsing logic to separate test cases from compliance reports
- Added fallback handling for different AI response formats
- Added validation to ensure proper output structure

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Added validation in the server action to check for empty or invalid responses
- Improved error messages to be more helpful to users
- Added client-side validation to provide immediate feedback

### 4. Improved Parser
- Enhanced the parser to handle cases where the AI response might include additional text
- Added logic to extract only the test cases portion before parsing

### 5. Better User Feedback
- Enhanced toast notifications with more specific error messages
- Added validation to ensure test cases are properly parsed before navigation

## Expected Improvements
These changes should result in:
1. More consistent test case generation
2. Better separation of test cases and compliance reports
3. More helpful error messages when issues occur
4. Improved reliability of the AI responses
5. Better user experience with clearer feedback

## Testing Recommendation
To test these improvements:
1. Try generating test cases with clear, specific requirements
2. Test with both file uploads and pasted requirements
3. Try edge cases like very short or very long requirement documents
4. Verify that compliance reports are properly generated and displayed
