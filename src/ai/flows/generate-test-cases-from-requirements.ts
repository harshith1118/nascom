**Title:** Medical Device User Authentication Validation
**Description:** Verify that the medical device system properly authenticates healthcare professionals before granting access
**Test Steps:**
1. Access the device login interface
2. Enter an unregistered user ID
3. Enter an incorrect password
4. Attempt to log in
5. Verify that access is denied
**Expected Results:** System displays authentication failure message and prevents unauthorized access
**Priority:** Critical

### Case ID: TC-002
**Title:** Patient Data Encryption Verification
**Description:** Ensure patient data is encrypted during transmission and storage according to healthcare standards
**Test Steps:**
1. Log into the system with authorized credentials
2. Navigate to patient records section
3. Access a patient's sensitive data
4. Attempt to extract data via unauthorized channels
5. Verify encryption protocols are enforced
**Expected Results:** All patient data is encrypted and inaccessible through unauthorized means
**Priority:** Critical

### Case ID: TC-003
**Title:** Medical Data Backup and Recovery Functionality
**Description:** Verify the system can reliably backup and restore critical medical data within required timeframes
**Test Steps:**
1. Generate a set of test patient records
2. Trigger the backup process
3. Simulate a data loss scenario by deleting recent records
4. Execute the recovery process
5. Verify all data integrity after recovery
**Expected Results:** All data is successfully backed up and recovered without corruption
