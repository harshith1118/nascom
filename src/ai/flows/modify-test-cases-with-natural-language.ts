**Title:** Enhanced Medical Device Authentication Validation
**Description:** Verify multi-factor authentication requirements for medical device access with biometric validation
**Test Steps:**
1. Access the medical device interface
2. Enter primary authentication credentials
3. Complete biometric validation
4. Attempt device access without secondary validation
5. Verify access is denied without complete authentication
**Expected Results:** Device remains locked until full multi-factor authentication is completed
**Priority:** Critical

### Case ID: TC-002
**Title:** Improved Patient Data Access Control
**Description:** Verify role-based access controls prevent unauthorized patient data access in multi-department environments
**Test Steps:**
1. Log in with nurse account credentials
2. Navigate to cardiology patient records
3. Attempt to access radiology reports
4. Verify access is denied based on role permissions
5. Log in with authorized radiologist account
**Expected Results:** Access granted only with appropriate role-based permissions
**Priority:** Critical

### Case ID: TC-003
**Title:** Advanced Medical Alert System Validation
**Description:** Verify the medical alert system properly flags critical patient conditions and triggers appropriate notifications
**Test Steps:**
1. Access patient monitoring interface
2. Simulate critical vital sign parameters
3. Verify alert system triggers
4. Confirm notifications are sent to appropriate medical staff
5. Validate alert escalation protocols
**Expected Results:** Medical staff receive timely alerts with appropriate priority levels
**Priority:** Critical`
