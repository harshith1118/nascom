## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#499CF5) to reflect both competence and innovation. The hue of sky blue gives a feeling of cleanliness often associated with medical settings, while being significantly more vivid than the typical light blues found in the healthcare sector.

- Accent color: Violet (#A076F1) to highlight important actions and information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font. Inter provides a neutral, machined, objective, and modern look for a professional appearance.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent test case elements and actions.
- Clean and structured layout with clear hierarchy to facilitate easy navigation and understanding.
- Subtle animations to provide feedback and guide the user through the test case creation process.
